# Learning-Python-GUI
I am using the instructional videos provided by The New Boston on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJB1Ek2Ko_Y to learn the Tkinter
Python GUI API. I am posting my code for each lesson, sometime combining two lessons into one file when two sequential lessons provide a 
small amount of material.
